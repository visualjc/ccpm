# CCPM Changelog

## [2026-03-19] - Skills-First Fork Migration

### Changed
- rebased the fork onto upstream's single `skill/ccpm/` layout
- removed legacy Claude/Cursor payload trees from `main`
- added project-local installers for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw, and `all`
- preserved context and testing workflows as additional references inside the single skill

### Added
- `skill/ccpm/references/context.md`
- `skill/ccpm/references/testing.md`
- `skill/ccpm/references/scripts/test-and-log.sh`
- `MIGRATION.md`
- `UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`
- `install/validate-skills-install.sh`

### Notes
- CCPM project data remains under `.claude/` across all harnesses
- the pre-migration layout is preserved locally via the `legacy-pre-skills-layout` tag and `codex/legacy-pre-skills-layout` branch
- warning on `visualjc/ccpm` or `automazeio/ccpm` as origin is intentional because both repos are treated as template sources

  - Improved overall structure and navigation

### 📋 Research & Community Engagement
- **Multi-Tracker Support Analysis** ([#200](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm/issues/200))
  - Researched CLI availability for Linear, Trello, Azure DevOps, Jira
  - Identified Linear as best first alternative to GitHub Issues
  - Provided detailed implementation roadmap for future development

- **GitLab Support Research** ([#588](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm/issues/588))  
  - Confirmed strong `glab` CLI support for GitLab integration
  - Invited community contributor to submit existing GitLab implementation as PR
  - Updated project roadmap to include GitLab as priority platform

### 🐛 Clarified Platform Limitations
- **Windows Shell Compatibility** ([#609](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm/issues/609))
  - Documented as Claude Code platform limitation (requires POSIX shell)
  - Provided workarounds and alternative solutions

- **Codex CLI Integration** ([#585](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm/issues/585))
  - Explained future multi-AI provider support in new CLI architecture

- **Parallel Worker Agent Behavior** ([#530](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm/issues/530))
  - Clarified agent role as coordinator, not direct coder
  - Provided implementation guidance and workarounds

### 🔒 Security
