# Example CCPM configuration
# Copy to .claude/.ccpmrc and customize
#
# Set the PRD directory path used by PM commands.
# Use a repo-relative path (no leading ./) and NO trailing slash.
# Examples:
# PRD_DIR=.claude/prds
# PRD_DIR=docs/prds

PRD_DIR=docs/prds

# === Workflow Mode Configuration ===
# Control parallel execution and worktree usage for human-in-the-loop vs agentic workflows

# PARALLEL_MODE: Launch parallel agents for faster execution?
# - true  = Multiple agents work concurrently (requires WORKTREE_MODE=true)
# - false = Sequential, human-controlled execution
# Default: true
PARALLEL_MODE=true

# WORKTREE_MODE: Use git worktrees for epic isolation?
# - true  = Create ../epic-xyz worktrees (isolated workspace)
# - false = Use branches in current directory (IDE-friendly)
# Default: true
WORKTREE_MODE=true

# 🔴 IMPORTANT: PARALLEL_MODE=true requires WORKTREE_MODE=true
# If WORKTREE_MODE=false, PARALLEL_MODE will be auto-disabled to prevent
# git lock conflicts from multiple agents in same directory.

# === Recommended Configurations ===
#
# 100% Agentic (default):
#   PARALLEL_MODE=true
#   WORKTREE_MODE=true
#   → Fast autonomous execution in isolated worktree
#
# Human-in-the-loop (recommended for IDE work):
#   PARALLEL_MODE=false
#   WORKTREE_MODE=false
#   → All work in current directory, full manual control
#   → See diffs in IDE, run tests manually, review each step
#
# Isolated + Manual:
#   PARALLEL_MODE=false
#   WORKTREE_MODE=true
#   → Separate worktree, but you control each step
