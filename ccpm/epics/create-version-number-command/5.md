# Task: Integrate version display into /pm:help command

## Description

Modify the existing `/pm:help` command script to display the CCPM version at the top of the help output. This ensures users can discover the version immediately when running the help command.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `claude-template/scripts/pm/help.sh` modified to read VERSION file
- [ ] Version displayed below the title banner
- [ ] Graceful fallback if VERSION file missing (shows "unknown")
- [ ] Existing help output unchanged (no breaking changes)
- [ ] Version line is clearly formatted and easy to read
- [ ] Changes are committed to git

## Technical Details

**File Location**: `claude-template/scripts/pm/help.sh`

**Modification Location**: After the title banner, before the quick start section

**Code to Add**:
```bash
# Add after the title line, before the separator line
VERSION=$(cat claude-template/VERSION 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "Version: $VERSION"
```

**Current help.sh Structure** (lines 6-9):
```bash
echo "📚 Claude Code PM - Project Management System"
echo "============================================="
echo ""
echo "🎯 Quick Start Workflow"
```

**Modified Structure**:
```bash
echo "📚 Claude Code PM - Project Management System"
VERSION=$(cat claude-template/VERSION 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "Version: $VERSION"
echo "============================================="
echo ""
echo "🎯 Quick Start Workflow"
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use `2>/dev/null` to suppress error if VERSION file missing
- Fallback to "unknown" if file doesn't exist (defensive coding)
- Keep formatting consistent with rest of help output
- Don't break existing help structure

**Files Affected**:
- Modifies: `claude-template/scripts/pm/help.sh`

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 001 - VERSION file must exist for proper display
- [ ] Existing `/pm:help` command and help.sh script

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: S
- **Hours**: 0.2 (10-15 minutes)
- **Parallel**: false (modifies existing file, potential conflicts)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] help.sh successfully reads VERSION file
- [ ] Version displays correctly when running `/pm:help`
- [ ] Fallback works when VERSION file missing
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing help output
- [ ] All help sections still display correctly
- [ ] Changes are committed to git
- [ ] Tested with both VERSION file present and absent
