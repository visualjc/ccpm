# Task: Create /pm:version command definition (version.md)

## Description

Create the slash command definition file that defines the `/pm:version` command. This follows the established CCPM pattern where a markdown file with frontmatter instructs Claude how to execute the command.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File created at `claude-template/commands/pm/version.md`
- [ ] Contains proper YAML frontmatter with `allowed-tools: Bash`
- [ ] Instructions tell Claude to run the version.sh script
- [ ] Follows the same pattern as other simple commands (e.g., help.md)
- [ ] File is committed to git

## Technical Details

**File Location**: `claude-template/commands/pm/version.md`

**Pattern to Follow**: Based on `claude-template/commands/pm/help.md`

**Content Structure**:
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash
---

Run `bash .claude/scripts/pm/version.sh` and show the output.
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Keep it minimal (follows the pattern from help.md)
- Use relative path to script: `.claude/scripts/pm/version.sh`
- No additional instructions needed (script handles all logic)

**Files Affected**:
- Creates: `claude-template/commands/pm/version.md`

## Dependencies

- [ ] None - this task is independent of others

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: XS
- **Hours**: 0.1 (5 minutes)
- **Parallel**: true (can run independently)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Command file exists at correct path
- [ ] Frontmatter is valid YAML
- [ ] Script path is correct
- [ ] Follows established CCPM command pattern
- [ ] File is tracked in git
