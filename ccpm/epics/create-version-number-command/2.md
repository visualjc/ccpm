# Task: Create VERSION file with initial version number

## Description

Create the VERSION file that stores the CCPM template system version number. This file will be the single source of truth for version information and will be read by both the `/pm:version` command and `/pm:help` command.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File created at `claude-template/VERSION`
- [ ] Contains single line with version in format: `YYYY.MM.DD.N`
- [ ] Initial version number is `2025.10.21.0`
- [ ] File has no trailing whitespace or newlines
- [ ] File is committed to git

## Technical Details

**File Location**: `claude-template/VERSION`

**Content Format**:
- Single line containing: `YYYY.MM.DD.N`
- Where:
  - `YYYY.MM.DD` = Calendar date of release (e.g., 2025.10.21)
  - `N` = Semantic counter for multiple releases on same day (starts at 0)

**Example Content**:
```
2025.10.21.0
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- No YAML frontmatter (this is not a markdown file)
- Plain text file
- Use Unix line endings (LF)
- No trailing newline after the version number

## Dependencies

- [ ] None - this is an independent task

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: XS
- **Hours**: 0.1 (5-10 minutes)
- **Parallel**: true (can run independently)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] VERSION file exists at correct path
- [ ] Contains properly formatted version number
- [ ] Can be read by bash scripts using `cat claude-template/VERSION`
- [ ] File is tracked in git
